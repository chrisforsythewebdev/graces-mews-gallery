      bio: `Dick Jewell is a London born and based multidisciplinary artist. Jewell graduated from the Royal College of Art with an MA in Printmaking in 1978. His practice encompasses photography, filmmaking, collage and publishing.
  
      For the last 40 years Jewell has produced a recurring theme of portraiture that captures, preserves and reflects the infinite human condition, exploring the passage of time, chance and serendipity. Since the mid 1970s, Jewell has collected thousands of images from photo booths. Raised three children over 18 years, most of which has been recorded relentlessly, and observed, documented and participated in the passage of time through numerous long-term and recurring series. His work has been shown widely at ICA, Serpentine, Whitechapel, Tate Britain, and Arnolfini. Jewell’s films have screened at MoMA, New York; the National Film Theatre; Whitechapel Gallery; Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; and Rio de Janeiro Film Festival.`,
